# tcc-project
Windows batch files building a C-project with Tiny C-Compiler

Add this repository as the `tcc-project` subfolder in your project root and execute `project-init.bat`. This will create `build.cmd`, `clean.cmd` and `run.cmd`. You can probably guess what these command do. You need `tcc.exe` on you environment path for this to work.
